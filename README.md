# RecruitTagScanner
 Scans Arknights screenshots for recruit tags that will give a 4* or better operator

Just take a screenshot of the recruitment screen and the app will attempt to detect the tags present and show a notification (either with a 4* or better match, or that there is no 4* or better combination).

Has options to attempt to delete screenshots which have recruit tags (note: this may require additional permissions on Android 11), and to clear notifications related to the screenshot (mostly for Samsung devices currently)
